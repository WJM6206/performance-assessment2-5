        <h2>Hi, My name is Will</h2>
        <p>Going back in history to the 15 of Feburary 2006, I was entering boot camp north of Chicago, IL.
            Being from Florida, it was a little cold. After training, I was off on my way to the
            USS Dwight D. Eisenhower Aircraft carrier. Here I would spend the next few years traveling 
            around the world in support of securing the very freedoms this great country enjoys. This 
            traveling allowed me to do many fun things. AFter the Navy, I continued doing the same great
            job as a civilian. This job was calibration and repair of advanced electronic equipment both
            on and off various ships and boats. After 15 years of calibration experience, I have now
            moved on to working for the National Weather Service maintaining weather observation stations
            at various airports, Emergency Weather Radio transmitters, and NEXRAD (NEXt Generation RADar)
            WSR-88D operation and repair.
